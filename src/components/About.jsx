      This React app is all about learning how to create multiple pages using <strong>React Router</strong>. It helps you understand how to move between pages, use route parameters, and build a smooth user experience with a clean layout.

      <li>A simple Home page to welcome users and guide them</li>
      <li>An About page (this one!) to explain what the app is all about</li>
      <li>A Users page that lists people and links to their profiles</li>
      <li>All styled neatly using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6 text-sm lg:text-md">
      The main goal is to get comfortable with routing and organizing your code into components, so itâ€™s easier to scale as your app grows.
